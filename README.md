#Sinagpore Bus_App

The bus app is programmed inside snack online expo and mainly have been tested on my personal android phone, model: samsung a705mn.
Iâ€™ve used the emulator for ios on the snack preview and it works fine within the emulator, however push notifications are turned off in the ios version.

How to run the Bus App on snack:

1. All appropriate files are placed correctly:

Project / components / keys / LTA_APIKey.js

Project / components / static_data / Bus_stops.json

Project / components / Details.js

Project / components / Favourites.js

Project / components / Home.js

Project / components / Search.js

Project / components / Settings.js

Project / App.js

Project / package.json


2. Add the appropriate dependencies/packages into package.json.

3. Run the android emulator or on an android device.

NOTE: Do not use the web browser as the searchable dropdown and notification will not work on the browser.
